# MigraineV2_Fixed
Fixed and cracked.

HOW TO BUILD:

Add the missing packages by just installing the missing ones from nuget (You can find which ones are missing in References).

Run it.

I removed the token logger so you'll have to add in your own token. And some stuff might be broken, feel free to maintain the code yourself.
